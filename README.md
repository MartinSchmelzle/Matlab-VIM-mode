A script for VIM mode in MATLAB: So far, the keybindings i, a, h, j, k, l, arrows, gg, G, and dd are supported. This work relies mainly on workarounds for the absence of MATLAB features (e.g. threading, cursor line manipulation). It could be better; I appreciate any help :) Just run it as a .m file or set a keystroke (e.g. Alt+1) to start it. 

Credits to Jos van der Geest for creating the getkey function, which this work relies upon.
